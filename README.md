🎟️ Real-Time Event Ticketing Platform
Overview
The Real-Time Event Ticketing Platform is a sophisticated solution designed to streamline event ticketing processes, making them more efficient, responsive, and user-friendly. The platform consists of three core components:

Command-Line Interface (Java): Implements core logic using the Producer-Consumer model to manage concurrent ticket releases and purchases.
Frontend (React.js): Provides an interactive interface to manage tickets, vendors, customers, and system settings.
Backend (Spring Boot): Handles API requests, data persistence, and the business logic behind ticketing operations.
This project combines modern technologies to create an efficient and dynamic ticketing solution that scales and adapts in real-time.
